# Work-Day-Scheduler
A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

# Usage
I created this project to save the to-do lists into the local storage. Simply type an event into the text box and click on the 'Save' button to see the changes. The busy periods will show in red, the past hours in grey and the available slots in green.
